Dove "Ex Machina"

She is also a guild member, the owner of Dove Industry, producing all cutting-edge devices with the newest technology and her magic.

No one can tell what exactly her ability is, but it seems that she can easily produce all devices from air and dust.

<b>Since her company is a sponsor, she could not join the match, but originally there was no rule prohibitting her from playing... perhaps someone reported her on purpose.</b>
