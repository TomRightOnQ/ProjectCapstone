Veronique Eunicinalla "Crystal Field"

Sounds like she is the smartest person in this world; while she does not have a strong mana for strong spell, once connected to external hardware, she could create supernaturally strong computation power.

Veronique is a guild member normally, but she has to run the game; the virtual world is created based on Dove's hardware.
